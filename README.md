# Udacity DRL Project 2 - Continuous Control

## Project's goal

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, **the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.**

In this project I have chosen to use a Policy Based method called [DDPG (Deep Deterministics Policy Gradient)](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html)

### Environment details

The environment is based on [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). The project environment provided by Udacity is similar to the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page.

> The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API. 

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

For this project, Udacity has provided two separate versions of the Unity environment:
- The first version contains a single agent.
- The second version contains 20 identical agents, each with its own copy of the environment.

The second version is useful for algorithms like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), [A3C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01783.pdf), and [D4PG](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyZipzbCb) that use multiple (non-interacting, parallel) copies of the same agent to distribute the task of gathering experience.

### Solving the Environment

Depending on the chosen environment for the implementation, there are 2 possibilities:

- Option 1: Solve the First Version
  - The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes. 

- Option 2: Solve the Second Version
  - The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents. In particular, the agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically:
    - After each episode, the rewards that each agent received (without discounting) are added up , to get a score for each agent. This yields 20 (potentially different) scores. The average of these 20 scores is then used.
    - This yields an average score for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

  - The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30.


**In my implementation I have chosen to solve the First version of the environment (Single Agent) using the off-policy DDPG algorithm.** The task is episodic, and **in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.**

## Instructions
Run the [`DDPG_Continuous_Control.ipynb`](Continuous Control Main.ipynb) notebook using the drlnd kernel to train the DDPG agent.

Use `ddpg` function to perform the training. This function returns a dictionary containing relevant internal variables that can be fed again to this function to continue training where it was left. Play around with this, change hyper parameters in between training runs to train your own intuition.

Once trained the model weights will be saved in the same directory in the files `checkpoint_actor.pth` and `checkpint_critic.pth`.
